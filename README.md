# Morning AI Assistant
This is a small AI Assistant project of mine which can be run on Android using Expo-Go or as a desktop app using tkinter

The AI Assistant is equiped with tools such as:
  "World News"
    -Returns the top news articles from a specified country with parameters, such as 'country', 'category' and 'querry'
  "Current Weather"
    -Tells you the current weather of a location that you would like to know about
  "Random Fact"
    - Tells you a random fact or a fact of the day to lighten up your mood in the morning
  "Coordinates City"
    -This returns precise coordinates of a city that you would like to know about
  "Stocks Yesterday"
    -Tells you what the price of a specified stock was a day ago (Could have Implemented "Stocks Now", but it was a part of a paid plan)
  "Name Days of Today"
    -Reminds you the names of people that are celebrating their name day today
  "Compare Stock Values"
    -Let's you compare stock values of your previous stock purchases to the stock price of that same stock today indicating how much % has been gained or lost. Additionally, this adds the purchase value of your stock to the systems local database, which is used if you call this function, without mentioning the old purchase price
  "Delete Purchase Price"
    -Deletes the purchase price of a certain stock from the local database in case you have sold this stock
  "Update Purchase Price"
    -Updates the purchase price of a certain stock if you have purchased the stock at a new price or previously have sold and now purchased it again
